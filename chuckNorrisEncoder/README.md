# Chuck Norris Encoder

# How to run it:
type in your terminal:
python3 callchuckNorrisEncoder.pyw

this app is complete based on the puzzle-code presented in codingame.com, I desided to convert it in a python desktop app, Below you will find the encoder rules and the link to codingame web page if you want to solve it by your own using the codingame platform.

# Rules:

1. 0 0 (the first series consists of only a single 1)
2. 00 0000 (the second series consists of four 0)
3. 0 00 (the third consists of two 1)

# Mechanics:
the code will convert to binary every letter of your message then it will encode it using the rules, giving you a message built with only zeros (0) 

# Example:

input: 
hello world

output:
0 00 00 0 0 0 00 000 0 00 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 000 00 0 0 00 00 00 0 00 00 0 0 00 00 00 0 00 00 0 0 0000 00 0 0 0 00 00000 0 000 00 0 0 00000 00 0 0 0000000 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 00 00 0 0 00 00 00 0 00 00 00 0 0 00 00 

It is a fun way to encode your messages to your friends. Right now the app does not decode, I will include that function in the future

Have a nice one :)
